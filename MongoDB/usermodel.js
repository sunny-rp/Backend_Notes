//Mongoose:- Mongoose is a Node.js library that provides a clean and powerful way to interact with MongoDB using schemas and models.
//It's an ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool â€” similar to how ORMs (like Sequelize for SQL) work.

/*Mongoose helps by:

Defining schemas (structure and types for documents)

Creating models (to interact with collections)

Adding validations

Supporting middleware (e.g., pre-save hooks)

Making database queries easier and safer

*** Mongoose is commonly used to connect a Node.js server to a MongoDB database.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        */

    name:String,
